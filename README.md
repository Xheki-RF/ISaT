In first work (3-4), we are making a 2D visualisation of datasets using such algorithms as T-SNE and UMAP.

In second work (5-6), we are using SVM, KNN and RF classifiers with different parameters. Then we are using Grid search to find best parameters, training classifiers using those parameters and then visualising the data and calculating Recall, F1-score and Precision.
